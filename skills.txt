I hope that after completing the course I will be able to:
1) Write simple JS code for my own and work needs;
2) Understand what our frontend developers have written;
3) Use Postman's autotests to their full potential, not just the built-in samples;
4) Write beautiful and working autotests of API, UI, etc.
